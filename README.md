# Web3Laravel

A laravel twitter clone made by Margarita and Sebas for the course web3.

Includes all required content for weeks 1-5

Plus additional/not required content:

4.3: Change the processing of the profile image. Besides scaling it
should also be circle shaped.

5.2: Export (formatted) content with image(s) to PDF
5.6: Extend the Laravel web application to include an Admin section.
In this section users with sufficient rights should be able to
CRUD all the content & users.  (Only applicable for CRUD use on users.)


Overall this app lets you make posts on your profile page where other people can reply too. You are able to chat with other people on this platform privately.
You are able to download your own posts as a PDF file and if you're an admin you can download all the user info as an excel file.
As a user you are able to CRUD your own profile and posts. As an admin you are able to CRUD other peoples profiles.

During profile creation it's possible to upload your own images limited by size. And will be later formatted to fit a circle definition.


We hope you enjoy this app!
